## 🎯 What Does This Do?

The AI Auto-Play feature is a **comprehensive autonomous gameplay system** that plays Murder vs Sheriff Duel for you. Unlike basic auto-aim or auto-shoot, this AI handles **EVERYTHING**:

- 🎮 **Intelligent Movement** - Navigates, positions, and evades
- 🎯 **Smart Combat** - Aims, shoots, and switches weapons
- 🧠 **Strategic Thinking** - Assesses threats, retreats when needed
- 🤝 **Team Awareness** - Works in team modes
- 🔄 **Adaptive Behavior** - Adjusts to different situations

## 📊 How It Works

```

**Every 0.05 seconds**, the AI:
1. Assesses the situation (enemies, health, position)
2. Selects the best target (nearest/weakest/strongest)
3. Calculates optimal movement position
4. Executes movement and evasive maneuvers
5. Aims and shoots at targets
6. Switches weapons based on distance
7. Makes strategic decisions (retreat/advance)

## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Usage (3 Steps)

1. **Load the Main script** in your Roblox executor
2. **Open the GUI** and go to the **AI Auto-Play** tab
3. **Enable "Enable AI Auto-Play"** toggle

**That's it!** The AI will now play the game for you automatically.

### What You'll See

Once enabled:
- ✅ Your character moves automatically
- ✅ Camera aims at enemies
- ✅ Shoots when appropriate
- ✅ Dodges and strafes
- ✅ Switches weapons
- ✅ Retreats when health low
- ✅ Re-engages when safe

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Four Movement Styles

Choose how the AI moves:

| Style | Behavior | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | Charges enemies directly | Close combat, knife builds |
| **Balanced** | Maintains 30-40 stud distance | All-around gameplay |
| **Defensive** | Keeps distance, retreats if close | Gun builds, survival |
| **Evasive** | Zigzag patterns, unpredictable | Avoiding hits, confusing enemies |

### 2. Smart Target Selection

Three priority modes:

- **Nearest**: Targets closest enemy (default, best for most situations)
- **Weakest**: Targets lowest health enemy (finish off wounded)
- **Strongest**: Targets highest health enemy (eliminate threats first)

### 3. Intelligent Combat

- **Auto Aim**: Camera automatically tracks targets
- **Auto Shoot**: Fires when target in range (<500 studs)
- **Weapon Switch**: 
  - Gun for range (>15 studs)
  - Knife for close combat (≤15 studs)

### 4. Strategic Decisions

- **Health Management**: Retreats when health below threshold
- **Threat Assessment**: Evaluates danger from nearby enemies
- **Aggression Control**: Adjustable play style (0.0 = passive, 1.0 = very aggressive)

### 5. Evasive Maneuvers

- **Random Dodging**: Jumps randomly to evade (10% chance per update)
- **Strafing**: Circles around targets
- **Distance Control**: Maintains optimal combat distance
