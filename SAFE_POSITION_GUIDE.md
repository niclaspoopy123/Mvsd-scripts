# Safe Position Calculator - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Safe Position Calculator analyzes the map in real-time to find the safest locations based on enemy positions, available cover, and escape routes. It helps you survive longer by positioning optimally.

## What Does It Do?

### 🛡️ **Real-Time Safety Analysis**
- Calculates threat level at any position
- Finds nearest cover from current location
- Evaluates escape route quality
- Scores positions based on multiple factors

### 🎯 **Intelligent Positioning**
- Identifies safest spots on the map
- Balances distance from enemies with cover availability
- Ensures good escape routes
- Updates dynamically as situation changes

### 🤖 **Auto-Movement (Optional)**
- Can automatically move to safe position when threatened
- Integrates with AI Auto-Play system
- Activates during retreat scenarios
- Smooth pathfinding to safety

## How to Use

### Quick Start (2 Steps)

1. **Open the GUI** and navigate to the **"Safe Position"** tab
2. **Enable "Enable Safe Position Calculator"** toggle

Now you can manually find safe positions or enable auto-movement.

### Manual Usage

1. Enable the calculator
2. Click **"Find Safe Position Now"** button
3. View coordinates of safest position
4. Manually move there if desired

### Automatic Usage (with AI)

1. Enable **Safe Position Calculator**
2. Enable **Auto-Move to Safe Position**
3. Enable **AI Auto-Play**
4. Set AI Health Threshold (e.g., 30%)

Now when health drops below threshold, AI will automatically move to the safest position!

## Features in Detail

### 1. Threat Calculation

For each position, the system calculates:
- Distance to all enemies
- Threat level (closer enemies = higher threat)
- Combined threat from multiple enemies
- Threat decay over distance

**Formula**: 
```
For each enemy within 100 studs:
  threat += (100 - distance) / 100
```

Result: Threat level from 0.0 (safe) to 1.0+ (dangerous)

### 2. Cover Detection

The system identifies cover by:
- Scanning map for large objects (>5 studs)
- Calculating distance to cover
- Evaluating cover quality
- Prioritizing closer cover

**Cover Quality Score**:
```
quality = 1.0 / max(1, distance_to_cover / 10)
```

Better cover is closer and provides more protection.

### 3. Escape Route Analysis

Tests 8 directions from each position:
- North, South, East, West
- Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest

Each direction scored by:
- Threat level 20 studs in that direction
- Number of viable escape routes
- Quality ratio (good routes / total routes)

### 4. Position Scoring

Final score for each position:
```
score = 
  -threat_level * THREAT_WEIGHT +
  cover_quality * COVER_WEIGHT +
  escape_quality * ESCAPE_ROUTE_WEIGHT
```

**Default Weights:**
- Threat: 1.0 (most important)
- Cover: 0.8 (important)
- Escape Routes: 0.6 (helpful)

Higher score = safer position

## Configuration Options

### Basic Settings

| Setting | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Calculator** | ON/OFF | OFF | Master toggle |
| **Auto-Move to Safe** | ON/OFF | OFF | Automatic movement |

### Advanced Settings

| Setting | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Safe Distance Threshold** | 20-100 | 50 | Minimum safe distance from enemies (studs) |
| **Cover Search Radius** | 30-200 | 100 | How far to search for cover (studs) |
| **Threat Weight** | 0-2 | 1.0 | Importance of distance from enemies |
| **Cover Weight** | 0-2 | 0.8 | Importance of nearby cover |
| **Escape Route Weight** | 0-2 | 0.6 | Importance of escape routes |

### Global Configuration

```lua
getgenv().safePositionConfig = {
    ENABLED = false,
    AUTO_MOVE_TO_SAFE = false,
    SAFE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 50,
    COVER_SEARCH_RADIUS = 100,
    THREAT_WEIGHT = 1.0,
    COVER_WEIGHT = 0.8,
    ESCAPE_ROUTE_WEIGHT = 0.6,
}
```

## Position Scoring Example

### Scenario:
- 2 enemies nearby
- Cover 15 studs away
- 6 of 8 escape routes are safe

### Calculation:
```
1. Threat Level: 0.7 (2 enemies close)
2. Cover Quality: 0.67 (decent cover nearby)
3. Escape Quality: 0.75 (6/8 routes safe)

Score = -0.7 * 1.0 + 0.67 * 0.8 + 0.75 * 0.6
      = -0.7 + 0.536 + 0.45
      = 0.286 (moderately safe)
```

### Comparison:
- Position A: 0.286 (moderate)
- Position B: -1.2 (very dangerous - multiple enemies, no cover)
- Position C: 0.8 (very safe - far from enemies, good cover)

**Best Choice**: Position C (highest score)

└─────────────────────────────┘

Threat Heatmap:
High Threat (Red):    Around enemies
Medium (Yellow):      Middle areas
Low Threat (Green):   Position S
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No safe position found"
- All positions may be dangerous
- Try increasing Safe Distance Threshold
- Consider retreating far from combat area
- Check if enemies are everywhere

### "Calculator not working"
- Ensure **Enable Calculator** is ON
- Verify character is spawned
- Check Game Analytics is running (provides cover data)

### "Auto-move goes to wrong place"
- Adjust weight sliders to prioritize different factors
- Increase Cover Weight if ignoring cover
- Increase Threat Weight if too close to enemies

## Performance

- **CPU Usage**: 1-2% during calculation
- **Memory**: ~200 bytes per cached position
- **Update Rate**: 2 Hz (every 0.5 seconds)
- **Sample Grid**: 11x11 points (121 positions tested)
- **Sample Area**: 100x100 stud area around player

Optimized for real-time performance without lag.

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Position Checking

```lua
-- In Lua console or script
local myPos = localPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.Position
local enemies = {} -- populate with enemy players

local safePos = safePositionCalc:findSafestPosition(myPos, enemies)
print("Safest position:", safePos)
```

### Custom Weight Presets

Save favorite weight combinations:
- **Survival Mode**: High threat avoidance
- **Cover Fighter**: Prioritize cover
- **Escape Artist**: Best escape routes

### Integration Example

```lua
-- Custom retreat logic
function customRetreat()
    if getgenv().safePositionConfig.ENABLED then
        local myPos = getMyPosition()
        local enemies = getEnemyList()
        local safePos = safePositionCalc:findSafestPosition(myPos, enemies)
        
        -- Move to safe position
        moveCharacterTo(safePos)
    end
end
```

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Use with ESP**: Visual confirmation of safe areas
2. **Combine with Aimbot**: Shoot while moving to safety
3. **Adjust for Map**: Different weights work better on different maps
4. **Monitor Statistics**: Track survival rate with different settings
5. **Save Presets**: Use Progression System to save preferred weights
