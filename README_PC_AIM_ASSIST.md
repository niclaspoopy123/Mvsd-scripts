## üìã Detailed Feature Guide

### Mouse Tracking
**What it does**: Automatically moves your camera to follow the nearest enemy player.

**Configuration Options**:
- **Tracking Smoothness** (0.1-1.0)
  - Lower = Instant, responsive
  - Higher = Smooth, natural-looking
  - Recommended: 0.5
  
- **Mouse Sensitivity** (0.1-3.0x)
  - Multiplier for tracking speed
  - Higher = Faster tracking
  - Recommended: 1.0x
  
- **Tracking Distance** (100-1000 studs)
  - Maximum range to track enemies
  - Enemies beyond this range are ignored
  - Recommended: 500 studs

### Hitbox Expansion
**What it does**: Makes enemy hitboxes larger, making them easier to hit.

**Configuration**:
- **Range**: 0-30 studs (enforced maximum)
- **Default**: 0 (disabled)
- **Recommended**: 5-15 studs for balanced gameplay
- **Effect**: Invisible to enemies, affects hit detection only

**How it works**:
- Creates invisible Part objects welded to enemy characters
- Expands hitbox in all directions (X, Y, Z)
- Updates dynamically for all enemies
- Automatically removes when disabled

### Auto-Reload Per Round
**What it does**: Automatically re-enables aim assist at the start of each round.

**Behavior**:
- Monitors player Match attribute to detect rounds
- Re-enables aim assist when entering a new round
- Continues until manually disabled by user
- No need to re-enable after each death/round

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Mouse tracking not working
**Problem**: Camera doesn't follow enemies

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure "Enable PC Aim Assist" is ON
2. Verify "Mouse Tracking" toggle is enabled
3. Check that enemies are within tracking distance
4. Try increasing tracking distance slider
5. Verify no enemies are behind you (tracks visible enemies)

### Hitboxes not expanding
**Problem**: No visible effect from hitbox expansion

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure hitbox expansion is set above 0
2. Verify the feature is enabled
3. Check that enemies are alive and in range
4. Note: Hitboxes are invisible (this is intentional)

### Auto-reload not activating
**Problem**: Feature doesn't re-enable each round

**Solutions**:
1. Confirm "Auto-Reload Per Round" is toggled ON
2. Wait for a complete round cycle
3. Feature monitors Match attribute - may require round start
4. Try toggling auto-reload OFF then ON again

### Tracking feels too fast/slow
**Problem**: Mouse movement is uncomfortable

**Solutions**:
1. Adjust "Tracking Smoothness" (higher = slower)
2. Modify "Mouse Sensitivity" (lower = less aggressive)
3. Try balanced settings first: 0.5 smoothness, 1.0x sensitivity
4. Fine-tune in small increments (0.1 at a time)

2. Calculate camera direction to enemy's head
3. Smooth interpolate current camera to target direction
4. Apply smoothness and sensitivity multipliers
5. Update camera CFrame with new direction

### Hitbox Expansion System

2. Set Part properties (Transparency=1, CanCollide=false)
3. Weld Part to enemy's HumanoidRootPart
4. Update size dynamically based on slider value
5. Remove all Parts when feature disabled

### Auto-Reload Mechanism

2. Detect when Match attribute becomes true (in game)
3. Check if aim assist is disabled
4. Re-enable aim assist and mouse tracking
5. Continue monitoring until manually disabled

6. **Team Play**: Respects team settings - won't track teammates
7. **Range Awareness**: Increase tracking distance for open maps
8. **Close Combat**: Use higher sensitivity for close-range fights
9. **Sniping**: Lower sensitivity and smoothness for long-range
10. **Auto-Reload**: Keep it ON for continuous gameplay
