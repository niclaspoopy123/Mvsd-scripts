- Switches weapons based on distance (gun for range, knife for close)
- Prioritizes targets (nearest, weakest, or strongest)
- Coordinates with existing ML Auto Shoot feature

### üß† **Strategic Decision Making**
- Assesses threat level from nearby enemies
- Retreats when health is low
- Seeks cover when needed

| **Dodge Enabled** | Random jumping/dodging to evade | ON |
| **Strafe Movement** | Circle strafing around targets | ON |

#### Movement Styles Explained

- **Aggressive**: Charges directly at enemies, closes distance quickly
- **Balanced**: Maintains optimal 30-40 stud distance, uses strafing
- **Defensive**: Keeps distance, backs away if enemies too close
- **Evasive**: Zigzag patterns, unpredictable movement

### Combat Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Combat AI** | Enable combat decision making | ON |
| **Auto Aim** | Automatically aim camera at targets | ON |
| **Auto Shoot** | Automatically shoot at enemies | ON |
| **Auto Weapon Switch** | Switch between gun/knife based on distance | ON |
| **Target Priority** | How to select targets (nearest/weakest/strongest) | nearest |

#### Target Priority Explained

- **Nearest**: Targets closest enemy (best for most situations)
- **Weakest**: Targets enemy with lowest health (finish off wounded)
- **Strongest**: Targets enemy with highest health (eliminate threats)

### Strategy Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Strategy AI** | Enable strategic thinking | ON |
| **Health Retreat Threshold** | Health % to trigger retreat | 30% |
| **Aggression Level** | How aggressive AI plays (0.0-1.0) | 0.7 |

#### Aggression Level Guide

- **0.0-0.3**: Very passive, focuses on survival
- **0.4-0.6**: Cautious, balanced approach
- **0.7-0.8**: Aggressive, actively seeks combat
- **0.9-1.0**: Very aggressive, charges enemies

### Performance Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Decision Rate** | How often AI thinks (seconds) | 0.1 |
| **Movement Update Rate** | How often movement updates (seconds) | 0.05 |

**Note**: Lower rates = faster reactions but more CPU usage

## Tips and Tricks

### For Best Performance

1. **Start with Default Settings**: Test before customizing
2. **Match Movement to Weapon**: 
   - Gun users: balanced or defensive
   - Knife users: aggressive or evasive
3. **Adjust Aggression**: Lower in team modes, higher in duels
4. **Use with ML Auto Shoot**: Disable AI's Auto Shoot, use ML for shooting
5. **Monitor Health Threshold**: Adjust based on your skill level

### Combining Features

**Ultimate Auto-Play Setup:**
```
‚úì AI Auto-Play: ON
  - Movement: balanced
  - Auto Aim: ON
  - Auto Shoot: OFF
  - Weapon Switch: ON

‚úì ML Auto Shoot: ON
  - Confidence: 0.7
  - Prediction Frames: 5

‚úì ESP: ON (for monitoring)
‚úì Team Check: ON
```

This setup uses AI for movement and ML for precise shooting!

### Troubleshooting

#### AI Not Moving
- Check if Movement AI is enabled
- Verify character is loaded
- Check if retreating (health too low)

#### AI Not Shooting
- Enable Auto Shoot or use ML Auto Shoot
- Check if weapon is equipped
- Verify enemies in range (<500 studs)

#### AI Dying Too Quickly
- Increase Health Retreat Threshold (40-50%)
- Use defensive movement style
- Lower aggression level (0.4-0.5)
- Enable Dodge

#### AI Too Passive
- Increase Aggression Level (0.8-0.9)
- Use aggressive movement style
- Lower Health Retreat Threshold (20%)

#### Performance Issues
- Increase Decision Rate (0.2-0.3)
- Increase Movement Update Rate (0.1)
- Disable some visual features (ESP)

## How It Works

### Decision Flow

```
Every 0.1 seconds:
  1. Assess Situation
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Calculate threat level
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Check health status
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Evaluate surroundings
  
  2. Select Target
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Find all valid enemies
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Apply priority strategy
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Choose best target
  
  3. Make Movement Decision
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Calculate optimal position
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Apply movement style
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Execute movement command
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Add evasive actions
  
  4. Execute Combat
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Aim at target
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Decide when to shoot
     ‚îú‚îÄ> Switch weapons if needed
     ‚îî‚îÄ> Use abilities
```

### Movement Algorithm

The AI calculates optimal position based on:
- Distance to target
- Current threat level
- Health status
- Movement style
- Environmental factors

**Example (Balanced Style)**:
- If distance > 45 studs ‚Üí Move closer
- If distance < 25 studs ‚Üí Move away
- If 25-45 studs ‚Üí Circle strafe
- Random jump every ~10 updates

### Combat Logic

**Weapon Selection**:
- Distance > 15 studs ‚Üí Use Gun
- Distance ‚â§ 15 studs ‚Üí Use Knife

**Shooting Decision**:
- Target selected: YES
- Distance ‚â§ 500 studs: YES
- Line of sight: YES
‚Üí Fire weapon

**Target Priority Calculation**:
```lua
if priority == "nearest" then
  score = 1000 - distance
elseif priority == "weakest" then
  score = (100 - health) + (500 - distance * 0.5)
elseif priority == "strongest" then
  score = health + (500 - distance * 0.5)
end
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Strategies

You can create custom strategies by adjusting settings:

**Tank Strategy** (High survivability):
```
Movement: defensive
Aggression: 0.3
Health Threshold: 60%
Target: weakest
Dodge: ON
```

**Assassin Strategy** (High damage):
```
Movement: evasive
Aggression: 0.8
Health Threshold: 25%
Target: strongest
Weapon Switch: ON
```

**Support Strategy** (Team play):

Aggression: 0.5
Health Threshold: 40%
Target: nearest
Team Check: ON
```
